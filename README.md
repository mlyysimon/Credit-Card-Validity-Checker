# Credit Card Validity Checker

Uses the Luhn Algorithm to determine the validity of the credit card number. Credit card can be inputted with hyphens or spaces. The Luhn Algorithm begins with the rightmost digit and the doubling of every other digit. If the double is greater than or equal to 10, the sum of each digit in the double is taken. The card number is valid when the total sum of the modified digits is divisable by 10.
